Bottom line:  
       git branch : view/ create branch
       git remote : view/ craeate remote
       git remote add "remoteName" "remoteUrl" : most common remote name is origin 
       git remote -v : show info on the remote (verbose)
       git push "remote" "branch" 

1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

   * when I am confident that my work done so far can be shared we others
   * when I want to have an online backup of my repository that I can access from any PC
   * when I want to collaborate with others on the project

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   I want to have control full control over what I am working on, on my local repository (I see it sort of like working on a different branch).
   Only after finishing my task I can then pull changes from the remote repository and fix any conflicts that might appear (same as
   merging one branch into another, just that they are in different locations, one on my PC, another online).
