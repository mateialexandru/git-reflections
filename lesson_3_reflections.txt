Bottom line:  
       git branch : view/ create branch
       git remote : view/ craeate remote
       git remote add "remoteName" "remoteUrl" : most common remote name is origin 
       git remote -v : show info on the remote (verbose)
       git push "remote" "branch" 

1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
