1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

   You get a empty repository where you can start adding commits.
   You need this in order to start versioning your files.

Bottom line:
       git init
       git status

			WORKING DIRECTORY
				|
			STAGING AREA
				|
			REPOSITORY

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

   It is the bridge between what we have in the repository and what we
have on our directory.
   You can make granular commits so don't have to commit all the changed
files from the directory at once, instead you can select which modified
fields (changes) you want to add to the staging area and the commit them.

Bottom line:
       git diff : compares working dir with staging area
       git diff --staged : compares staging area with last commit
from the repository (HEAD)
       git reset --hard : removes changes from working directory and
staging area
